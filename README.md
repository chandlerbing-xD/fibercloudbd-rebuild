# FiberCloudBD Website Rebuild (Static Architecture)

## Overview
This project is a high-performance static rebuild of the existing
[FiberCloudBD](https://fibercloudbd.com/) website, inspired by
modern ISP sites like Google Fiber and Sonic. The goal is to deliver a fast, clean, responsive, and well-documented ISP website without using a traditional database or heavy CMS.

## Why This Project
The current site is functional but can be improved in:
- Performance (faster loading)
- Responsiveness (mobile-first design)
- Modern design and layout
- Documentation of design and technical decisions

## Goals
- Rebuild the site exactly in terms of content and sections
- Implement with Astro + Tailwind (modern static architecture)
- Optimize images, animations, and layout for speed
- Document every architectural and design decision
- Produce a portfolio-quality project suitable for jobs and academic review

## Non-goals
- No backend user accounts
- No database-driven CMS
- No extra features beyond the current site

## Status
Planning & documentation phase
