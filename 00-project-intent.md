# Project Intent & Architectural Decisions

## Problem Statement
The existing FiberCloudBD website can be rebuilt with modern static technologies to improve speed, maintainability, and overall UX.

## Reference Analysis
We reviewed:
- Google Fiber (modern, clean design)
- Sonic.com (minimal, fast)
- Existing FiberCloudBD site

We decided to combine clarity and modern styling with exact content replication.

## Key Decisions
- **Static-first architecture**: No database; pages pre-built
- **Astro**: HTML-first framework, component-based, minimal JS
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid responsive styling without complex CSS
- **Performance priorities**: Lazy-load images/videos, CDN hosting, minimal JS

## Learning Objectives
- Learn Astro + Tailwind in a real project
- Understand static site architecture
- Document professional decision-making

## Evaluation Criteria
- Homepage matches original site content/layout
- Clean, readable, modern design
- Performance optimized
- Documentation complete and professional
